# Telenotes CMS test  by Reynaldo Pena
I have use angular 4 and 5 as a hobby, it was nice to test, and learn more about this powerful framework. I enjoy creating this mini spa with angular using as well redux. 

This project was generated with that features:

- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) as a main framework.
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) which implements the google material design.
- [ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/tree/master/modules/store) Reactive Extensions for Angular that allow the use of redux as state management.
- [ngrx/store-devtools](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/tree/master/docs/store-devtools) Store instrumentation that enables a powerful time-travelling debugger.
- [Angular Router](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/router) that allow the user to navigate.
- The store create a [dictionary](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA/Paper_1/Fundamentals_of_data_structures/Dictionaries) for managing data to speed up the search process.
- [Responsive Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) but not fully optimized but it works ok in phones.
- [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) as a style sheet language.
- [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) help to render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) module bundler.
